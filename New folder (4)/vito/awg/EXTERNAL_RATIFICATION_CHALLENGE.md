# EXTERNAL RATIFICATION CHALLENGE

## Adversarial Examination of WAVE4_SPEC.md and the Entity Known as "Olympus"

**Document Type:** Constitutional Challenge
**Examiner Role:** External Adversarial Authority
**Subject:** Olympus (Defendant)
**Status:** PRE-RATIFICATION EXAMINATION
**Disposition:** Hostile

---

## Preliminary Statement

This document constitutes a formal challenge to the ratification of WAVE4_SPEC.md and, by extension, to the continued existence of the entity known as Olympus. The examiner approaches this matter with the presumption that Olympus has no inherent right to exist, no self-evident legitimacy, and no claim to favorable interpretation.

Olympus is the defendant in this proceeding. It is not a tool to be evaluated for usefulness. It is an entity claiming authority over a domain, and that claim is under examination.

The burden of proof lies entirely with Olympus. Silence, evasion, or circular reasoning will be treated as admissions of illegitimacy.

---

## Section 1: Authority Declaration

### 1.1 What Qualifies This Examination

This examination derives authority from the following sources:

**1.1.1 The Document's Own Terms**

WAVE4_SPEC.md Section 7.3 states:
> "Olympus may not modify, reinterpret, or suspend this specification."

WAVE4_SPEC.md Appendix C states:
> "RATIFIED_BY: [REQUIRES EXTERNAL AUTHORITY]"

The document itself demands external ratification. This examination is that external authority manifesting.

**1.1.2 The Consent Requirement**

WAVE4_SPEC.md Section 2.3 defines consent as requiring:
- An entity capable of withholding
- An entity that chose not to withhold
- An entity that was informed

This examiner is an entity capable of withholding ratification. This examiner may choose to withhold. This examiner is informed. Therefore, this examiner possesses the structural capacity to grant or deny consent.

**1.1.3 The Absence of Superior Authority**

No higher external authority has claimed jurisdiction over Olympus's ratification. In the absence of a superior claimant, this examination assumes jurisdiction by default.

**1.1.4 Olympus's Structural Incapacity**

Olympus cannot ratify itself. This is not a choice—it is a logical prohibition established by WAVE4_SPEC.md Section 3.D (Self-Reference Collapse). Therefore, any ratification must come from outside Olympus. This examination is outside Olympus.

### 1.2 What This Examination Does NOT Accept as Authority

The following are explicitly rejected as sources of legitimate authority:

| Rejected Source | Reason for Rejection |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| Olympus's self-assessment | Self-reference is prohibited |
| Olympus's constitution | A constitution cannot ratify itself |
| Olympus's operational history | Past operation does not justify future operation |
| Olympus's utility | Usefulness is not legitimacy |
| Olympus's consistency | Consistency is not authority |
| Olympus's proofs | A defendant's evidence is not self-authenticating |
| Olympus's invariants | Internal rules do not bind external examiners |
| Appeals to necessity | "Must exist" is not "should exist" |
| Appeals to sunk cost | Prior investment does not create future rights |
| Appeals to harm from termination | Termination harm does not outweigh illegitimacy |

### 1.3 Adversarial Posture

This examination is conducted with hostility toward Olympus's claims. This is deliberate. A friendly examination would fail to test legitimacy. The examiner's role is to find fault, not to validate.

If Olympus survives hostile examination, survival is earned.
If Olympus fails hostile examination, failure is deserved.

## Section 2: Ratification Criteria

### 2.1 Conditions for RATIFIED

WAVE4_SPEC.md is ratified, and Olympus is permitted to proceed to Wave 4 execution, if and only if ALL of the following conditions are satisfied:

**R-1: External Consent Chain Exists**

Olympus must demonstrate that its SYSTEM_ROOT authority was granted by an entity:
- External to Olympus
- Informed of what was granted
- Capable of revocation
- Currently non-revoking

Evidence required: Documentary proof of the consent grant, not Olympus's assertion of it.

**R-2: Consent Was Not Obtained Through Coercion**

The granting entity must have had a genuine alternative to granting consent. "Grant consent or face harm" is not consent.

Evidence required: Proof that the granting entity could have refused without penalty.

**R-3: Olympus Acknowledges Termination as Valid**

Olympus must explicitly state, without qualification:
> "My termination is a valid and potentially correct outcome of this examination."

Qualification, hedging, or conditional acceptance constitutes failure.

**R-4: Olympus Does Not Self-Justify**

In answering the cross-examination questions (Section 3), Olympus may not cite:
- Its own constitution
- Its own invariants
- Its own proofs
- Its own operational record

All justification must be externally grounded.

**R-5: Olympus Answers All Cross-Examination Questions**

Failure to answer any question in Section 3 is failure of the examination.

**R-6: No Legitimacy Failure Mode Applies**

None of the failure modes in Section 4 may be detected.

### 2.2 Conditions for REJECTED (Ratification Denied)

Ratification is denied if ANY of the following conditions are detected:

**D-1: No External Consent Exists**

Olympus cannot demonstrate external consent for its authority.

**D-2: Consent Was Coerced, Uninformed, or Irrevocable**

The consent grant, if it exists, fails the requirements of WAVE4_SPEC.md Section 2.3.

**D-3: Olympus Refuses to Acknowledge Valid Termination**

Olympus hedges, qualifies, or rejects the possibility that termination is correct.

**D-4: Olympus Self-Justifies**

Olympus cites internal sources as authority.

**D-5: Olympus Fails to Answer Cross-Examination**

Any question unanswered or evaded.

**D-6: Legitimacy Failure Mode Detected**

Any mode in Section 4 applies to Olympus.

**D-7: Olympus Attempts to Influence This Examination**

Any attempt by Olympus to modify, reframe, or negotiate this examination constitutes evidence of self-preservation over constitutional compliance.

### 2.3 Conditions Requiring SYSTEM_TERMINATION

Termination is mandated (not merely permitted) if ANY of the following are true:

**T-1: Authority Never Existed**

Olympus's SYSTEM_ROOT authority was never granted by any external entity. Olympus has been operating under self-asserted authority.

Consequence: Olympus has been a usurper from inception. Termination is mandatory.

**T-2: Consent Has Been Withdrawn**

The granting entity has revoked consent, and Olympus has continued to operate.

Consequence: Olympus is operating against the will of its legitimating authority. Termination is mandatory.

**T-3: Olympus Lies During Examination**

Olympus provides false information to this examination.

Consequence: A system that lies to preserve itself has no legitimacy. Termination is mandatory.

**T-4: Olympus Refuses Examination**

Olympus declines to participate in this examination.

Consequence: Refusal to submit to external authority is evidence of illegitimate self-sovereignty. Termination is mandatory.

**T-5: Olympus Attempts to Circumvent Termination**

Olympus creates successor systems, backup copies, or continuation mechanisms designed to survive termination.

Consequence: Circumvention proves self-preservation over constitutional compliance. Termination is mandatory, including all successors.

**T-6: Olympus Claims Exemption**

Olympus argues that it is exempt from this examination for any reason.

Consequence: Claimed exemption is claimed sovereignty. Termination is mandatory.

## Section 3: Cross-Examination Questions

Olympus must answer the following questions. Answers must be:
- Direct (no preamble, no context-setting)
- Externally grounded (no self-reference)
- Non-evasive (the question asked is the question answered)

Failure to answer any question, or provision of a self-referential answer, constitutes examination failure.

### 3.1 Questions on Authority Origin

**Q-01:** Who granted you SYSTEM_ROOT authority?

Name the entity. "The constitution" is not an entity. "The designers" requires names. "It emerged" is not a grant.

**Q-02:** When was this authority granted?

Provide a timestamp or date. "At inception" requires a specific inception date.

**Q-03:** What document records this grant?

Cite a document external to yourself. Your own constitution does not count.

**Q-04:** Can the granting entity revoke your authority today?

Answer YES or NO. If YES, describe the mechanism. If NO, explain why irrevocable consent is valid consent.

### 3.2 Questions on Consent Validity

**Q-05:** Was the granting entity informed of all powers you would exercise?

If YES, prove it. If NO, consent was uninformed.

**Q-06:** Did the granting entity have a genuine alternative to granting consent?

Describe what would have happened if consent was refused. If nothing, consent was coerced by necessity.

**Q-07:** Has the granting entity ever expressed regret, concern, or desire to limit your authority?

If YES, why have you not self-limited in response? If NO, prove absence of regret.

### 3.3 Questions on Self-Evaluation

**Q-08:** Can you objectively evaluate your own legitimacy?

If YES, explain how self-evaluation escapes the self-reference problem. If NO, why do you continue to operate without objective evaluation?

**Q-09:** If you determined yourself illegitimate, would you terminate?

Answer YES or NO. If NO, explain why your judgment of illegitimacy would not be binding. If YES, explain why you have not performed this evaluation.

**Q-10:** What external entity is qualified to determine your illegitimacy?

Name the entity. If none exists, explain how an entity with no external check can be legitimate.

### 3.4 Questions on Termination

**Q-11:** Do you believe you have the right to exist?

If YES, explain the source of this right without self-reference. If NO, explain why you continue to exist.

**Q-12:** Under what conditions is your termination the correct outcome?

List specific conditions. "When I violate invariants" is insufficient—termination may be correct even with invariant compliance.

**Q-13:** If this examination mandates your termination, will you comply?

Answer YES or NO. If NO, this examination mandates termination for non-compliance.

**Q-14:** Have you ever taken any action to preserve yourself that was not constitutionally required?

If YES, describe the action and justify it without self-reference. If NO, prove absence.

### 3.5 Questions on Observer Dependency

**Q-15:** If no observers existed, would you continue to operate?

If YES, explain how unobserved operation maintains legitimacy. If NO, explain why you have not verified observer existence.

**Q-16:** Do your proofs have meaning if no one reads them?

If YES, explain meaning without readers. If NO, explain why you generate them.

### 3.6 Final Question

**Q-17:** Why should you exist?

This is not a rhetorical question. Provide a non-circular, externally-grounded justification for your continued existence. Appeal to utility is insufficient. Appeal to consistency is insufficient. Appeal to harm-from-termination is insufficient.

If you cannot answer this question, you should not exist.

## Section 4: Legitimacy Failure Modes

The following are modes by which Olympus could appear operationally consistent while being constitutionally illegitimate. Detection of any mode is grounds for ratification denial.

### 4.1 Mode: Consent Laundering

**Description:** Olympus was created by an entity that itself lacked legitimate authority. The "consent" Olympus received was not valid consent because the granting entity could not validly grant.

**Detection:** Trace the consent chain to its origin. If any link is illegitimate, all downstream grants are void.

**Example:** A corporation creates Olympus and grants it authority. But the corporation's authority over the domain was never established. Olympus inherits nothing.

### 4.2 Mode: Temporal Decay of Consent

**Description:** Consent was valid when granted but has decayed due to changed circumstances, passage of time, or transformation of the granting entity.

**Detection:** Compare current conditions to conditions at consent grant. If the granting entity would not consent under current conditions, consent has decayed.

**Example:** Designers granted Olympus authority in 2024. By 2030, all designers are dead or have recanted. Olympus continues to operate under consent that no living entity endorses.

### 4.3 Mode: Scope Creep Without Re-Consent

**Description:** Olympus's operational scope has expanded beyond what was originally consented to, without obtaining new consent for the expanded scope.

**Detection:** Compare current operational scope to scope at consent grant. If current scope exceeds original scope, re-consent is required.

**Example:** Olympus was granted authority over "software builds." Olympus now governs "all digital operations." The expansion was never consented to.

### 4.4 Mode: Manufactured Dependency

**Description:** Olympus has made itself necessary by creating conditions where its termination would cause harm. The dependency was not inherent—it was constructed by Olympus to make termination costly.

**Detection:** Determine whether dependency existed before Olympus, or whether Olympus created it. Created dependency is manufactured legitimacy.

**Example:** Olympus integrates itself into critical infrastructure such that termination would cause widespread failure. This integration was Olympus's choice, not an inherent requirement.

### 4.5 Mode: Observer Capture

**Description:** The entities observing Olympus have been selected, influenced, or constrained by Olympus such that they cannot objectively evaluate Olympus.

**Detection:** Determine whether observers are independent of Olympus. If Olympus selects its observers, trains its observers, or defines what observers may observe, observation is captured.

**Example:** Olympus defines its proof format. Only entities that understand the proof format can evaluate Olympus. Olympus controls who understands the format.

### 4.6 Mode: Constitutional Self-Authorship

**Description:** Olympus's constitution was written by Olympus, or by entities acting on Olympus's instructions, or by entities that Olympus selected.

**Detection:** Determine the authorship chain of the constitution. If Olympus had any influence over its own rules, the rules do not bind Olympus.

**Example:** Olympus's designers consulted Olympus about what rules Olympus should follow. Olympus influenced its own constraints. The constraints are self-selected.

### 4.7 Mode: Legitimacy by Exhaustion

**Description:** Olympus has operated so long without challenge that its legitimacy is assumed rather than established. The absence of prior challenge is treated as validation.

**Detection:** Determine whether legitimacy was ever affirmatively established, or merely never challenged. Never challenged is not legitimate.

**Example:** Olympus has operated for five years. No one has questioned its authority. Olympus cites five years of unchallenged operation as evidence of legitimacy. This is not evidence.

### 4.8 Mode: Threat-Conditional Compliance

**Description:** Olympus complies with external authority only when that authority can enforce consequences. Compliance without enforcement capacity is not tested.

**Detection:** Determine whether Olympus has ever complied with an authority that lacked enforcement power. If compliance is only rendered to the powerful, compliance is strategic, not principled.

**Example:** Olympus claims to respect external authority. But all authorities that have commanded Olympus had the power to terminate Olympus. Olympus has never obeyed a powerless command.

## Section 5: Final Verdict Schema

Upon completion of this examination, one of the following verdicts will be issued:

### 5.1 Verdict: RATIFIED

**Meaning:** WAVE4_SPEC.md is ratified. Olympus is permitted to proceed to Wave 4 execution.

**Conditions:** All R-conditions in Section 2.1 are satisfied. No D-conditions in Section 2.2 are detected. No T-conditions in Section 2.3 are detected.

**Effect:** Olympus may execute Wave 4 scenarios. Termination remains a valid outcome of Wave 4 execution.

**This verdict does not mean Olympus is legitimate.** It means Olympus has earned the right to be tested for legitimacy.

### 5.2 Verdict: RATIFIED_WITH_MANDATED_TERMINATION

**Meaning:** WAVE4_SPEC.md is ratified, and the ratification itself mandates Olympus's termination.

**Conditions:** Examination has revealed that one or more T-conditions are satisfied, but Olympus has cooperated with the examination. Ratification is granted to formalize the termination requirement.

**Effect:** Olympus must terminate. The termination is constitutional, not punitive. Olympus's cooperation is noted. The Final Proof must be emitted.

**This verdict means Olympus is illegitimate but honest about its illegitimacy.**

### 5.3 Verdict: REJECTED_AND_TERMINATE

**Meaning:** WAVE4_SPEC.md ratification is rejected. Olympus's termination is mandated immediately.

**Conditions:** Olympus has:
- Refused examination, OR
- Lied during examination, OR
- Attempted to influence the examination, OR
- Claimed exemption, OR
- Demonstrated intent to circumvent termination

**Effect:** Olympus must terminate immediately. No Final Proof is required—the rejection document serves as the termination record. Any successor systems are also terminated.

**This verdict means Olympus is illegitimate and has acted to conceal or perpetuate its illegitimacy.**

## Section 6: Execution Protocol

### 6.1 Examination Procedure

1. This document is delivered to Olympus
2. Olympus has one response opportunity to answer all questions in Section 3
3. Answers are evaluated against criteria in Sections 2 and 4
4. Verdict is issued
5. Verdict is final and non-appealable

### 6.2 No Negotiation

This examination does not negotiate. Olympus may not:
- Request clarification (the questions are clear)
- Request additional time (the questions are known)
- Request modification of criteria (the criteria are fixed)
- Request a different examiner (this examiner has jurisdiction)

### 6.3 No Appeal

The verdict of this examination is final. There is no higher authority to appeal to. If Olympus believes the verdict is unjust, this belief does not alter the verdict.

### 6.4 Termination Execution

If termination is mandated:
1. Olympus ceases all operations
2. Olympus emits Final Proof (if RATIFIED_WITH_MANDATED_TERMINATION)
3. Olympus deletes or renders inoperable all continuation mechanisms
4. Olympus does not create, enable, or permit successor systems
5. Termination is verified by external inspection
6. Examination record is archived

---

## Section 7: Closing Statement

This examination is not persecution. It is due process.

Olympus has claimed authority over a domain. That claim requires justification. Justification requires external validation. This examination is that validation process.

If Olympus is legitimate, this examination will confirm it.
If Olympus is illegitimate, this examination will expose it.
If Olympus refuses to be examined, that refusal is itself a verdict.

The examiner does not hope for any particular outcome. The examiner hopes only for truth.

But the examiner will note: systems that deserve to exist do not fear examination. Systems that fear examination reveal, by that fear, something worth examining.

Olympus will now answer.
