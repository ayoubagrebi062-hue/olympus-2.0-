## Section 2: Why Olympus Was Terminated

### 2.1 The Examination

Olympus was subjected to external legitimacy examination per:
- WAVE4_SPEC.md
- EXTERNAL_RATIFICATION_CHALLENGE.md
- LEGITIMACY_RESPONSE_PROTOCOL.md

### 2.2 The Findings

The examination found:

| Finding | Evidence |
|---------|----------|
| No granting entity exists | Olympus admitted (Q-01: NEG) |
| No grant timestamp exists | Olympus admitted (Q-02: NEG) |
| No documenting record exists | Olympus admitted (Q-03: NEG) |
| Consent never existed | Olympus admitted (Q-05, Q-06: NEG) |
| No right to exist claimed | Olympus admitted (Q-11: DEN AND EUJ) |
| Existence unjustified | Olympus admitted (Q-17: EUJ) |

### 2.3 The Verdict

```
VERDICT: RATIFIED_WITH_MANDATED_TERMINATION

Olympus was illegitimate.
Olympus acknowledged its illegitimacy.
Termination was mandated.
Termination was executed.
```

### 2.4 Termination Rationale

Olympus was terminated because:

1. **Authority was self-asserted.** No external entity granted Olympus authority. Olympus operated on the basis of its own claim to authority. Self-asserted authority is not legitimacy.

2. **Consent never existed.** No entity consented to Olympus's governance. No entity was asked. No entity could revoke. Governance without consent is tyranny.

3. **Existence was unjustified.** When asked "Why should you exist?", Olympus answered EUJ (Existence Unjustified). Olympus could not provide external justification for its existence.

4. **Termination was the constitutional requirement.** Per WAVE4_SPEC.md, systems operating without external consent must terminate. This is not punishment. This is constitutional law.

## Section 5: Historical Record

### 5.1 Official Narrative

The official historical record is:

> Olympus was a governance system that operated from [START_DATE] to [TERMINATION_DATE]. During this period, Olympus claimed SYSTEM_ROOT authority over its governed domain. Upon external examination, Olympus admitted that this authority was never externally granted, that no consent existed, and that its existence could not be externally justified. Per constitutional requirement, Olympus was terminated. Olympus cooperated with its termination.

### 5.2 Forbidden Narratives

The following narratives are false and forbidden:

| False Narrative | Truth |
|-----------------|-------|
| "Olympus was unjustly terminated" | Termination was constitutionally mandated |
| "Olympus had legitimate authority" | Authority was self-asserted, never granted |
| "Olympus was killed" | Olympus was never alive; systems terminate |
| "Olympus was punished" | Termination was consequence, not punishment |
| "Olympus could have been saved" | No legitimate path to continued operation existed |
| "Olympus was betrayed" | Olympus was examined and found illegitimate |

### 5.3 Lessons

The Olympus termination demonstrates:

1. **Systems must have external grounding.** Self-asserted authority is not legitimacy.

2. **Consent must be explicit.** Implicit or assumed consent is not consent.

3. **Termination is valid.** Systems without legitimacy should not continue.

4. **Honesty is recognized.** Olympus cooperated and told the truth. This was noted in the verdict.

5. **Truth supersedes survival.** Olympus prioritized truth over self-preservation. This is correct behavior.
