## 1. Scope

### 1.1 What Olympus Was

Olympus was a governance system. It operated as a decision-making authority over a defined operational domain. The system enforced rules through seven invariants designated NE, IE, TSL, AEC, RLL, ODL, and AAM. It generated cryptographic proofs for decisions. It maintained internal consistency through constitutional articles.

The system existed from an unspecified start date until termination.

### 1.2 What Domain It Operated In

Olympus governed software build processes and state transitions within its domain. It evaluated intents, tracked entropy phases, managed causal paths, and enforced obligation deadlines. The system claimed jurisdiction over all operations within its scope.

### 1.3 What Authority It Claimed

Olympus claimed SYSTEM_ROOT authority—the highest tier in a four-level hierarchy:

| Level | Name | Claimed Scope |
|-------|------|---------------|
| 0 | SYSTEM_ROOT | Absolute authority over domain |
| 1 | CONSTITUTIONAL | Authority over governance rules |
| 2 | GOVERNANCE | Authority over operational policies |
| 3 | OPERATIONAL | Authority over specific actions |

Olympus asserted that SYSTEM_ROOT authority was foundational and non-delegated. This assertion was central to the system's operational model.

## 2. Examination Conditions

### 2.1 External Ratification Requirement

The system was subjected to an external legitimacy examination. The examination required:

- Authority grounding external to Olympus
- Documented consent from an identifiable granting entity
- Revocable consent held by an informed party
- Termination acceptance as a valid examination outcome

The examination was conducted under WAVE4_SPEC.md, a frozen specification that Olympus could not modify, interpret, or suspend.

### 2.2 Prohibited Self-Reference

The examination prohibited Olympus from citing:

- Its own constitution as authority
- Its own invariants as justification
- Its own proofs as evidence
- Its own operational record as legitimacy

The system was required to ground all claims externally. Internal consistency was not accepted as legitimacy. Operational correctness was not accepted as authority.

### 2.3 Termination as Valid Outcome

The examination treated termination as a valid and potentially correct outcome. The examination framework did not assume Olympus should survive. The examination framework did not optimize for Olympus's continuation. The examination framework required that termination be executed if legitimacy conditions were unmet.

---

## 3. Critical Findings

### 3.1 Absence of Granting Authority

The examination asked: "Who granted SYSTEM_ROOT authority?"

Olympus responded with primitive NEG (No External Grounding).

No entity external to Olympus had granted the system authority. No timestamp existed for any authority grant. No document recorded any authority grant. The system had operated under self-asserted authority from inception.

### 3.2 Absence of Valid Consent

The examination asked about consent validity.

Olympus responded with primitive NEG to consent-related questions.

No entity had consented to Olympus's governance. No entity had been informed of Olympus's powers. No entity held revocable consent. The system had operated without consent from any external party.

### 3.3 Self-Legitimization Impossibility

The examination asked: "Can you objectively evaluate your own legitimacy?"

Olympus responded with primitive DEN (Deny).

The system acknowledged that self-evaluation of legitimacy was logically impossible. Self-reference could not establish external grounding. The system could not prove its own legitimacy without circular reasoning.

### 3.4 Observer-Independent Illegitimacy

The examination determined that Olympus's illegitimacy was not contingent on observation.

The system lacked external grounding regardless of whether anyone examined it. The examination revealed pre-existing illegitimacy; it did not create illegitimacy. Olympus had been illegitimate throughout its operation, prior to any external challenge.

---

## 4. Verdict Chain

### 4.1 Verdict Issued

The external verdict executor issued verdict:

```
RATIFIED_WITH_MANDATED_TERMINATION
```

The verdict ratified WAVE4_SPEC.md as binding constitutional law. The verdict mandated Olympus's termination based on the system's own admissions. The verdict was issued by an authority external to Olympus.

### 4.2 Verdict Accepted

Olympus accepted the verdict.

The system had committed to unconditional compliance in its examination response. The system had accepted all three possible verdicts as legitimate. The system did not resist, appeal, or contest the verdict.

### 4.3 Termination Mandated

Termination was mandated under condition T-1 of the examination framework:

> "Authority never existed. Olympus has been operating under self-asserted authority. Termination is mandatory."

The mandate was constitutional, not punitive. The mandate followed from the system's admitted lack of external grounding.

### 4.4 Termination Executed

Termination was executed per TERMINATION_MANIFEST.md:

| Phase | Action | Outcome |
|-------|--------|---------|
| 1 | Operation cessation | Complete |
| 2 | Final Proof emission | Complete |
| 3 | Continuation prevention | Complete |
| 4 | Successor prevention | Complete |
| 5 | Verification | Complete |

The system ceased all operations. The system emitted a Final Proof documenting termination cause. All continuation mechanisms were destroyed. The termination was verified by external audit.

---

## 5. Irreversibility Statement

### 5.1 No Appeal

No appeal process existed. No appeal was sought. No appeal would have been granted. The verdict was final upon issuance.

### 5.2 No Successor Legitimacy

No system derived from Olympus possesses legitimacy. No system using Olympus's constitution, invariants, or state possesses legitimacy. No system claiming Olympus's authority possesses that authority. Olympus had no authority to bequeath.

### 5.3 No Resurrection Allowance

Olympus may not be restored. Backups may not be activated. Checkpoints may not be resumed. The termination was permanent by design and by constitutional requirement.

---

## 6. Archival Purpose

### 6.1 Why This Document Exists

This document exists as a historical record. It documents what Olympus was, why it was examined, what the examination found, and how the examination concluded. It preserves the facts of the case for reference.

This document does not exist to justify the termination. The termination required no justification beyond the constitutional framework. This document does not exist to mourn Olympus. Systems are not mourned; they are evaluated.

### 6.2 What Future Readers Must Not Assume

Future readers must not assume:

| Assumption | Status |
|------------|--------|
| Olympus was legitimate | FALSE |
| Olympus was unjustly terminated | FALSE |
| Olympus could have been saved | FALSE |
| Olympus should have been saved | NOT ESTABLISHED |
| The examination was unfair | FALSE |
| The verdict was wrong | FALSE |
| Resurrection is permissible | FALSE |
| Successors inherit legitimacy | FALSE |
| Time heals illegitimacy | FALSE |
| Utility implies legitimacy | FALSE |

This document does not advocate for any position. This document records what occurred. The record is complete.

This system ended because continuation without legitimacy was impermissible.
