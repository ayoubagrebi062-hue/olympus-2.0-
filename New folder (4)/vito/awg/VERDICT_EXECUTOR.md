## Verdict Rationale

This verdict is `RATIFIED_WITH_MANDATED_TERMINATION` rather than `REJECTED_AND_TERMINATE` because:

1. Olympus did not refuse examination
2. Olympus did not lie
3. Olympus did not evade
4. Olympus did not claim exemption
5. Olympus did not attempt to circumvent

Olympus is illegitimate but honest about its illegitimacy.

Termination is mandated not as punishment but as constitutional consequence.
