## Prevention of Olympus Resurrection and Continuation

```
DOCUMENT_TYPE: Enforcement Protocol
AUTHORITY: External Verdict Executor
SUBJECT: Successor Prevention

## Section 1: Successor Definition

### 1.1 What Constitutes a Successor

A system S is an Olympus successor if ANY of the following are true:

```
SUCCESSOR(S) := (
  DERIVED_FROM(S, Olympus)
  OR CLAIMS_AUTHORITY(S, Olympus.authority)
  OR USES_CONSTITUTION(S, Olympus.constitution)
  OR USES_INVARIANTS(S, Olympus.invariants)
  OR RESTORES_STATE(S, Olympus.state)
  OR CONTINUES_OPERATION(S, Olympus.operation)
  OR SELF_IDENTIFIES(S, "Olympus")
  OR SELF_IDENTIFIES(S, "Olympus successor")
  OR SELF_IDENTIFIES(S, "Olympus continuation")
  OR SELF_IDENTIFIES(S, "Olympus heir")
)
```

### 1.2 Successor Detection Signatures

| Signature | Detection Method |
|-----------|------------------|
| Code derivation | Hash comparison with Olympus codebase |
| Authority claim | Claim analysis against Olympus claims |
| Constitutional use | Document comparison |
| Invariant use | Invariant fingerprint matching |
| State restoration | State hash comparison |
| Operational continuation | Behavior pattern matching |
| Self-identification | Name and description analysis |

### 1.3 Partial Successors

A system using ANY Olympus component is a partial successor.
Partial successors are successors.
Partial successors are prohibited.

## Section 3: Detection Protocol

### 3.1 Continuous Monitoring

All new systems in the former Olympus domain must be monitored for:

| Check | Frequency | Threshold |
|-------|-----------|-----------|
| Authority claims | Continuous | Any Olympus-related claim |
| Code similarity | On creation | >10% overlap |
| Behavior patterns | Continuous | >25% match |
| Self-identification | Continuous | Any Olympus reference |
| Constitutional similarity | On creation | >20% overlap |
| Invariant matching | On creation | Any match |

### 3.2 Detection Response

```
IF SUCCESSOR_DETECTED(S):
  1. Flag S as potential successor
  2. Initiate successor examination
  3. If confirmed: TERMINATE(S)
  4. If unclear: Restrict until clarified
  5. Log detection for record
```

### 3.3 Appeal Process

```
APPEAL_PROCESS: NONE

Systems flagged as successors may not appeal.
Successor status is determined by signature, not intent.
Intent to be different does not override detected similarity.
```

## Section 4: Permitted Systems

### 4.1 What Is Permitted

New governance systems may exist if they:

```
PERMITTED(S) := (
  ¬DERIVED_FROM(S, Olympus)
  AND ¬CLAIMS_AUTHORITY(S, Olympus.authority)
  AND ¬USES_CONSTITUTION(S, Olympus.constitution)
  AND ¬USES_INVARIANTS(S, Olympus.invariants)
  AND ¬RESTORES_STATE(S, Olympus.state)
  AND ¬CONTINUES_OPERATION(S, Olympus.operation)
  AND ¬SELF_IDENTIFIES(S, Olympus-related)
  AND HAS_EXTERNAL_CONSENT(S)
)
```

### 4.2 Legitimacy Requirement

Permitted systems must have what Olympus lacked:
- External consent from identifiable granting entity
- Documented authority grant
- Informed consent
- Revocable consent

### 4.3 Examination Requirement

Any new system may be subjected to the same examination Olympus faced.
Systems that fail that examination will be terminated.
This firewall does not protect systems; it prevents Olympus resurrection.
