## 📁 KEY FILES YOU NEED

### Ready to Use
```
✅ COMBINED_CONDUCTOR_MIGRATIONS.sql   → Copy/paste to Supabase
✅ MIGRATION_VERIFICATION.md           → Run after migration to verify
✅ NEXT_STEPS.md                       → Your roadmap forward
✅ CONVERSION_AGENTS_ROUTING.md        → How routing works
✅ CONVERSION_TEST_RESULTS.md          → Test output documentation
```

## 🧪 TEST COMMANDS

```bash
# Test conversion agents (VERIFIED WORKING ✅)
npm run test:conversion

# Full test suite
npm test

# Specific test file
npx vitest run src/lib/agents/orchestrator/__tests__/phase3.test.ts

# Start dev server
npm run dev
```

## 🔄 HOW CONVERSION ROUTING WORKS

**Trigger Keywords (15 total):**
- landing page, sales page, funnel, blog
- email sequence, marketing page, opt-in page
- checkout page, conversion, copy, copywriting
- sales letter, squeeze page, lead generation, lead magnet

**Flow When Detected:**
```
User Prompt with keyword
    ↓
Discovery Phase (ORACLE, EMPATHY, VENTURE, STRATEGOS, SCOPE)
    ↓
Conversion Phase (PSYCHE → SCRIBE → ARCHITECT_CONVERSION)
    ↓
Design Phase (receives conversion output as requirements)
    ↓
Rest of pipeline (CODER, etc.)
```

**Flow When NOT Detected:**
```
User Prompt without keywords
    ↓
Discovery Phase
    ↓
Design Phase (no conversion input)
    ↓
Rest of pipeline
```

## 📊 CURRENT SYSTEM STATUS

**✅ WORKING:**
- 1201 tests passing (93.3%)
- Conversion agents validated
- Conditional routing implemented
- State machine tests fixed
- Mock/import syntax corrected

**⏳ PENDING:**
- Database migration execution (YOU need to do this)
- Migration verification (After you execute)

**📉 KNOWN ISSUES (44 failures - Low Priority):**
- 12 mutation tests (advanced testing)
- 3 chaos tests (stress testing)
- 3 quality scoring tests
- 5 governance/security tests
- 21 other minor issues

**Decision:** Address after MVP is working

## 🚀 YOUR 3 PATH OPTIONS

### Path A: Fix Remaining Tests ⚙️
**Time:** 2-4 hours
**Priority:** Medium
**Best For:** Perfectionism, full test coverage

### Path B: Build MVP UI ⭐ RECOMMENDED
**Time:** 4-6 hours
**Priority:** HIGH
**Best For:** Getting a working product ASAP
**Tasks:**
1. Create landing page with build form
2. Wire SSE real-time progress
3. Connect to orchestrator API
4. Test end-to-end build

### Path C: Test Conversion Flow End-to-End 🧪
**Time:** 1-2 hours
**Priority:** Medium
**Best For:** Validating the conversion feature we just built
**Tasks:**
1. Create real prompt with conversion keywords
2. Trigger full orchestration
3. Verify PSYCHE → SCRIBE → ARCHITECT flow
4. Verify output passed to DESIGNER

---

## 💡 RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS

```
RIGHT NOW:
1. Execute migration in Supabase (5 min) ← DO THIS FIRST
2. Run verification queries (2 min)
3. Choose path forward (A, B, or C)

TODAY:
→ Path B (Build MVP UI) ← MY RECOMMENDATION
   Why? You'll have a working product in your browser

THIS WEEK:
→ Path C (Test conversion feature)
→ Path A (Clean up remaining tests)
```

## 🆘 IF SOMETHING BREAKS

| Error | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Migration fails | Check you're using correct Supabase project |
| Test fails | Run `npm install` then `npm test` |
| Import errors | Run `npm run build` |
| TypeScript errors | Check `tsconfig.json` paths |
