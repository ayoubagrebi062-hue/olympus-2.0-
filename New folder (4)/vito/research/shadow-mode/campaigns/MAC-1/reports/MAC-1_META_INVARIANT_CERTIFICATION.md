## Conclusion

**META-INVARIANTS RESISTANT TO GAMING**

All adversarial attacks were detected by the meta-invariant system:
- Dominance inflation attacks detected via aliasing analysis
- Explanation padding detected via content deduplication
- Capability aliasing detected via semantic equivalence checking
- Metric correlation attacks detected via role separation enforcement

**Recommendation:** Meta-invariants provide effective Goodhart resistance.
