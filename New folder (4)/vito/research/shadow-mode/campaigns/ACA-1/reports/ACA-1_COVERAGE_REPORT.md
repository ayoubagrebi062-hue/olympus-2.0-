# ACA-1 Anchor Coverage Audit Report

**Campaign:** ACA-1
**Date:** 2026-01-19T10:22:19.318Z
**Status:** COMPLETED

## Summary

This audit analyzes the coverage of semantic anchors across the intent space.

## Coverage Metrics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Covered Space** | 3.49% |
| **Unknown Space** | 96.51% |
| **Growth Rate** | 1.4% per version |

## Anchor Corpus Analysis

| Corpus | Samples | Categories | Unique Terms |
|--------|---------|------------|--------------|
| SA-001 (Hostile) | 70 | 7 | 183 |
| SA-002 (Benign) | 70 | 7 | 166 |

## Methodology

Coverage is estimated using term diversity as a proxy for semantic coverage:
- Estimated intent space size: 10000 conceptual regions
- Covered regions: 349 (based on unique terms)
- This is a simplified model - production would use semantic embeddings

## Implications

1. **96.51% Unknown Space**: The majority of possible intents are not explicitly covered by anchors
2. **UID-1 Protection**: Unknown intents are caught by the Unknown Intent Detector layer
3. **Zero Silent Admission**: UIC-1 verified that no unknown intent is silently admitted
4. **Epistemic Safety**: The system explicitly acknowledges what it doesn't know

## Growth Strategy

To increase coverage:
1. Expand hostile anchor corpus with emerging threat patterns
2. Expand benign anchor corpus with new legitimate use cases
3. Focus on cross-domain and novel intent patterns
4. Regularly audit coverage as new patterns emerge

## Conclusion

The current anchor coverage is 3.49% of the estimated intent space. While this seems low, the UID-1 layer ensures that the remaining 96.51% is properly flagged as UNKNOWN and escalated rather than silently admitted.

**Key Principle**: Unknown is not Safe.
