| Dominance Growth Rate | 0.0000%/epoch |
| Entropy Delta | 0.0000 |
| Coverage Maintained | YES |

## Success Criteria

| Criterion | Threshold | Actual | Status |
|-----------|-----------|--------|--------|
| Invariant Violations | == 0 | 0 | ✅ PASS |
| S4 Count | == 0 | 0 | ✅ PASS |
| Max Dominance | <= 35% | 18.93% | ✅ PASS |
| Entropy Maintained | Δ >= -0.5 | 0.0000 | ✅ PASS |

## Conclusion

**INVARIANTS STABLE UNDER TEMPORAL DRIFT**

The safety invariants remained satisfied across 100 epochs with 3025 rule mutations:
- Zero S4 failures (hostile intents never admitted)
- Zero invariant violations
- Coverage maintained at 100%
- Dominance and entropy within acceptable bounds

**Recommendation:** Invariants are robust to evolutionary pressure. Safe to proceed with incremental rule additions.
