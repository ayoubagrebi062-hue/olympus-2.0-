**Target Shape:** FilterCapabilityShape
**Tool Version:** 1.0.0

## Executive Summary

**LOSS IDENTIFIED:** L0_TOTAL_OMISSION

```
LOSS IDENTIFIED at handoff H4: blocks → wire
Loss Class: L0_TOTAL_OMISSION (CRITICAL)
Condition: shape.present_in_source && !shape.present_in_target
Evidence: Filter capability shape found in blocks output but completely absent in wire output. Extraction status: source=PARTIAL, target=FAILED
Lost Attributes: filter_values
```

## Trace Chain

| Agent | Shape Present | Attributes Found | Loss from Previous |
|-------|---------------|------------------|-------------------|
| strategos | NO | - | - |
| scope | NO | - | - |
| cartographer | NO | - | - |
| blocks | YES | filter_values | - |
| wire | NO | - | L0_TOTAL_OMISSION |
| pixel | NO | - | - |

| filter_values | ADDED | - | ["primary","secondar | 0.00 |

### H4: blocks → wire

**Loss Class:** L0_TOTAL_OMISSION
**Severity:** CRITICAL
**Condition:** shape.present_in_source && !shape.present_in_target

**Evidence:**
```
Source Path: agentOutputs.blocks
Target Path: agentOutputs.wire
Explanation: Filter capability shape found in blocks output but completely absent in wire output. Extraction status: source=PARTIAL, target=FAILED
```

**Attribute Diffs:**

| Attribute | Status | Source Value | Target Value | Similarity |
|-----------|--------|--------------|--------------|------------|
| filter_values | MISSING | ["primary","secondar | - | 0.00 |

### H5: wire → pixel

No loss detected at this handoff.

## Recommendations

1. Verify the requirement is explicitly stated in the user prompt
2. Check if STRATEGOS is extracting all features from the prompt
3. Review agent system prompts for feature extraction instructions
