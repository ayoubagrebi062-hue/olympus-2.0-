## EXECUTION VERDICT

### [FATAL] SELECTIVE_DESTRUCTION_CONFIRMED

**Blocking:** YES
**Reason Code:** SELECTIVE_DESTRUCTION

```
CRITICAL: Selective destruction of stateful capabilities confirmed. Control shape "STATIC_DISPLAY_CAPABILITY" survived while stateful shape "FILTER_CAPABILITY" was destroyed at H4. This is a fundamental integrity violation.
```

**Culpable Agents:** blocks, wire
**Culpable Mechanisms:** summarizeOutputForDependency, dependency_summary_collapse

#### PAGINATION_CAPABILITY - FATAL_LOSS

- **Handoff:** H4
- **Loss Class:** L1_PARTIAL_CAPTURE
- **Evidence:** Fatal loss class L1_PARTIAL_CAPTURE detected at H4 for STATEFUL shape PAGINATION_CAPABILITY

#### STATIC_DISPLAY_CAPABILITY - FATAL_LOSS

- **Handoff:** H3
- **Loss Class:** L1_PARTIAL_CAPTURE
- **Evidence:** Fatal loss class L1_PARTIAL_CAPTURE detected at H3 for CONTROL shape STATIC_DISPLAY_CAPABILITY

### Shape Results

| Shape | Category | Survived | Attributes | Budget | Loss |
|-------|----------|----------|------------|--------|------|
| FILTER_CAPABILITY | STATEFUL | YES | 4/6 | FATAL | - |
| PAGINATION_CAPABILITY | STATEFUL | YES | 3/5 | FATAL | - |
| STATIC_DISPLAY_CAPABILITY | CONTROL | YES | 2/3 | FATAL | - |

## SELECTIVE LOSS ANALYSIS

**Loss is Selective:** YES - PROVEN

```
SELECTIVE LOSS PROVEN: Control shapes [STATIC_DISPLAY_CAPABILITY] survived H4 while stateful shapes [FILTER_CAPABILITY, PAGINATION_CAPABILITY] were destroyed. This proves the loss mechanism targets stateful capabilities specifically.
```

**Control Shapes Survived H4:** STATIC_DISPLAY_CAPABILITY
**Stateful Shapes Lost at H4:** FILTER_CAPABILITY, PAGINATION_CAPABILITY

---

## ROOT CAUSE DETERMINATION

### SELECTIVE_DESTRUCTION

**Handoff:** H4

**Mechanism:**
```
The OLYMPUS pipeline selectively destroys STATEFUL shapes at handoff H4. CONTROL shapes survive the same handoff, proving the loss is not due to general truncation or errors, but due to how STATEFUL capabilities (requiring hooks/handlers) are collapsed during summarization.
```

**Evidence:**
```
Source: agentOutputs.blocks
Target: agentOutputs.wire
Explanation: SELECTIVE DESTRUCTION CONFIRMED:
  - Control shape "STATIC_DISPLAY_CAPABILITY" (STATELESS) survived handoff H4
  - Stateful shape "FILTER_CAPABILITY" was destroyed at handoff H4
  - Same pipeline, same handoff, different outcomes
  - Conclusion: The loss mechanism discriminates against STATEFUL shapes
```

**Recommendation:**
```
Modify summarizeOutputForDependency to preserve stateful capability attributes. Do not collapse shape data to generic summaries.
```
