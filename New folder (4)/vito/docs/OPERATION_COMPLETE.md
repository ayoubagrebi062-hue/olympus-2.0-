## LESSONS LEARNED

### What Worked Well

1. **Systematic Agent Upgrades** - Wave-based approach ensured consistency
2. **Chaos Engineering** - Found 19 vulnerabilities before production
3. **8-Section Format** - Standardized outputs improve quality
4. **Type Guards** - Prevented runtime crashes on bad input

### Areas for Future Improvement

1. **Backend Agents** - Only 40% upgraded (GATEWAY, KEEPER need work)
2. **Integration Agents** - 0% upgraded (BRIDGE, SYNC, NOTIFY basic)
3. **Testing Agents** - 0% upgraded (JUNIT, CYPRESS basic)
4. **Enterprise Features** - Multi-tenant validation needed

---

## RECOMMENDATIONS

### Immediate (Before Launch)

1. Configure production environment variables
2. Set up monitoring and alerting
3. Enable error tracking (Sentry/similar)
4. Configure rate limiting for production

### Short-term (Week 1-2)

1. Run real builds to collect quality data
2. Identify weak spots from actual outputs
3. Prioritize Wave 6 agent upgrades
4. A/B test prompt variations

### Medium-term (Month 1)

1. Full backend agent coverage (Wave 6)
2. Integration agent upgrades (Wave 7)
3. Testing agent improvements (Wave 8)
4. Performance optimization
