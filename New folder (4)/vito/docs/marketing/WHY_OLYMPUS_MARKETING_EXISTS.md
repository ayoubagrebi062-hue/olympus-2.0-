# WHY THIS MARKETING SITE EXISTS

## Purpose

This marketing site exists to filter, not convert.

Most marketing sites optimize for:
- Maximum signups
- Minimum friction
- Broadest appeal

This site optimizes for:
- Qualified users only
- Explicit understanding before entry
- Narrow appeal to the right people

## The Filtering Philosophy

Every page on this site is designed to help potential users decide if Olympus is NOT for them. This is intentional.

**Why filter?**
- Users who understand what Olympus is convert better
- Users who misunderstand churn quickly
- Support burden decreases with qualified users
- Product-market fit improves with the right users

**How we filter:**
1. **Anti-pitch on homepage** - We tell you what Olympus is NOT
2. **Explicit "Who It's For" page** - Two lists: is for, is not for
3. **Technical governance details** - We don't hide complexity
4. **Real examples with failures** - We show builds that didn't work
5. **Qualification gate** - You must acknowledge constraints before entering

## Page Structure

| Page | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `/` | First filter: "This is not magic" |
| `/why-olympus` | Second filter: "This is different because..." |
| `/how-it-works` | Third filter: "Five concepts only" |
| `/governance` | Fourth filter: "Here's the friction" |
| `/who-its-for` | Fifth filter: "Is/Is Not lists" |
| `/examples` | Sixth filter: "Real builds, real failures" |
| `/enter` | Final gate: Acknowledgements required |
| `/docs/manifesto` | Principles: What we believe |

## Success Metrics

We do NOT optimize for:
- Total visitors
- Signup conversion rate
- Time on page

We optimize for:
- Qualification rate (users who read "is not for" and leave)
- Retention after first build
- Trust score maintenance
- User-generated decision trace quality

## Design Philosophy

**Light mode primary:** Professional, readable, serious
**Dark mode optional:** For users who prefer it

**Sans-serif for prose:** Inter for readability
**Monospace for technical:** System mono for code/diagrams

**No animations:** Nothing that distracts from content
**No carousels:** Everything visible, nothing hidden
**No popups:** No interrupt patterns

## Non-Goals
