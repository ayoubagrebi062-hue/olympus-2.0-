# NON-GOALS: OLYMPUS MARKETING SITE

This document lists what this marketing site explicitly does NOT try to do.

## Conversion Optimization

**NOT A GOAL:** Maximizing signup conversion rate

We do not:
- A/B test headline copy for higher clicks
- Minimize form fields to reduce friction
- Use urgency tactics ("Limited time!")
- Hide pricing until after signup
- Use exit-intent popups
- Track scroll depth for optimization

**INSTEAD:** We filter. Lower conversion of the right users is better than higher conversion of the wrong users.

## Broad Appeal

**NOT A GOAL:** Appealing to everyone who might use an AI builder

We do not:
- Claim Olympus is "for everyone"
- Hide the technical complexity
- Simplify the governance model for marketing
- Pretend gates are optional
- Suggest this is fast or easy

**INSTEAD:** We explicitly state who this is NOT for. We want people to self-select out.

## Hype

**NOT A GOAL:** Creating excitement through marketing language

We do not:
- Use superlatives ("Revolutionary!", "Game-changing!")
- Make claims we cannot demonstrate
- Promise outcomes we cannot guarantee
- Use social proof without context
- Employ FOMO tactics

**INSTEAD:** We state facts. We show examples. We let the work speak.

## Growth Hacking

**NOT A GOAL:** Viral loops, referral incentives, or growth mechanics

We do not:
- Offer "invite 3 friends" bonuses
- Gamify onboarding
- Create artificial scarcity
- Use waitlists as marketing
- Optimize for shares or retweets

**INSTEAD:** Users who find value tell others. That is sufficient.

## Design Trends

**NOT A GOAL:** Looking like other SaaS marketing sites

We do not:
- Use gradient backgrounds
- Add floating 3D illustrations
- Include animated hero sections
- Use "bento grid" layouts for features
- Follow whatever Tailwind UI ships

**INSTEAD:** Clean, readable, professional. The content is the design.

## Engagement Metrics

**NOT A GOAL:** Maximizing time on site or pages per session

We do not:
- Bury important information to increase scroll
- Create artificial content gates
- Split content across unnecessary pages
- Use infinite scroll
- Optimize for "engagement"

**INSTEAD:** Users should find what they need and decide quickly. Short visits that result in qualified decisions are success.

## Lead Capture

**NOT A GOAL:** Collecting emails for nurture campaigns

We do not:
- Gate content behind email walls
- Offer ebooks or whitepapers for emails
- Run drip campaigns
- Use marketing automation beyond transactional
- Send newsletters unless explicitly requested

**INSTEAD:** Enter or don't. No middle ground.

## Why These Non-Goals Matter

Every non-goal above is a standard SaaS marketing practice. Each is excluded intentionally because:

1. **Conversion optimization** creates users who don't understand
2. **Broad appeal** attracts users who will churn
3. **Hype** sets expectations we cannot meet
4. **Growth hacking** prioritizes quantity over quality
5. **Design trends** distract from substance
6. **Engagement metrics** measure the wrong things
7. **Lead capture** creates nurture burden without value

These non-goals are as important as the goals. They define what Olympus marketing is NOT.
