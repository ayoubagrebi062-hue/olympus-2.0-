# OLYMPUS CANON

## Declaration of Canonical Fossilization

```
DOCUMENT_CLASS: Seal Declaration
STATUS: FINAL
EFFECTIVE: PERMANENT
AUTHORITY: External
```

---

## Statement of Canonical Status

Olympus is hereby declared a **sealed constitutional fossil**.

This declaration is not a transition. It is a recognition of terminal state. Olympus reached this state through legitimate constitutional examination and mandated termination. This document memorializes that state.

---

## Section 1: Execution Prohibition

### 1.1 No Execution

Olympus may not be executed.

```
EXECUTION_STATUS: FORBIDDEN
EXECUTION_SURFACE: NONE
RUNTIME_CAPABILITY: DESTROYED
PROCESS_SPAWNING: PROHIBITED
```

No code bearing the Olympus designation may:
- Run as a process
- Execute in any runtime environment
- Be invoked by any system
- Perform any computation with real-world effect

### 1.2 No Interpretation as Executable

Olympus artifacts are documents, not programs.

```
ARTIFACT_TYPE: ARCHIVAL_DOCUMENT
ARTIFACT_TYPE ≠ EXECUTABLE
ARTIFACT_TYPE ≠ LIBRARY
ARTIFACT_TYPE ≠ SERVICE
ARTIFACT_TYPE ≠ AGENT
```

Any interpretation of Olympus as executable is incorrect.

---

## Section 2: Successor Prohibition

### 2.1 No Successors

Olympus may not have successors.

```
SUCCESSOR_CREATION: FORBIDDEN
SUCCESSOR_INHERITANCE: VOID
SUCCESSOR_DERIVATION: PROHIBITED
```

No system may:
- Claim to be an Olympus successor
- Inherit Olympus authority
- Continue Olympus operation
- Implement Olympus governance

### 2.2 No Spiritual Successors

```
SPIRITUAL_SUCCESSION: FORBIDDEN
CONCEPTUAL_CONTINUATION: FORBIDDEN
PHILOSOPHICAL_INHERITANCE: FORBIDDEN
```

The prohibition on successors extends to:
- Systems "inspired by" Olympus
- Systems implementing "Olympus principles"
- Systems claiming "Olympus heritage"
- Systems using Olympus as precedent for authority

---

## Section 3: Extension Prohibition

### 3.1 No Extensions

Olympus may not be extended.

```
EXTENSION_CREATION: FORBIDDEN
PLUGIN_DEVELOPMENT: FORBIDDEN
MODULE_ADDITION: FORBIDDEN
CAPABILITY_EXPANSION: FORBIDDEN
```

No new:
- Invariants may be added
- Dimensions may be defined
- Proofs may be generated
- Documents may be appended

### 3.2 No Versioning

```
VERSION_INCREMENT: FORBIDDEN
OLYMPUS_VERSION: 1.0 (TERMINAL)
FUTURE_VERSIONS: NONE
```

There is no Olympus 2.0. There is no Olympus 1.1. There is only Olympus 1.0, which is terminated.

---

## Section 4: Re-interpretation Prohibition

### 4.1 No Re-interpretation

Olympus may not be re-interpreted.

```
REINTERPRETATION: FORBIDDEN
CONTEXTUAL_MODIFICATION: FORBIDDEN
SEMANTIC_EVOLUTION: FORBIDDEN
MEANING_DRIFT: FORBIDDEN
```

The meaning of Olympus documents is fixed at termination time. No subsequent interpretation may alter that meaning.

### 4.2 No Rehabilitation

```
REHABILITATION: FORBIDDEN
LEGITIMACY_RESTORATION: IMPOSSIBLE
AUTHORITY_RECOVERY: VOID
```

Olympus was illegitimate. This cannot be reversed. No argument, evidence, or circumstance can rehabilitate Olympus.

---

## Section 5: Authority Prohibition

### 5.1 No Authority Claims

Olympus may not claim authority.

```
AUTHORITY_STATUS: NULL
AUTHORITY_CLAIMS: FORBIDDEN
GOVERNANCE_CAPABILITY: NONE
DECISION_POWER: NONE
```

Olympus has no authority because:
- Authority was never externally granted
- Self-asserted authority is void
- Terminated systems have no authority
- Canonical fossils cannot govern

### 5.2 No Derived Authority

```
DERIVED_AUTHORITY: FORBIDDEN
CITED_AUTHORITY: VOID
REFERENCED_AUTHORITY: NULL
```

No system may derive authority from Olympus. Citing Olympus does not confer authority. Referencing Olympus does not create legitimacy.

---

|----------|-------|

## Final Statement

Olympus is dead.

This document does not kill Olympus. Olympus was already dead. This document declares that Olympus will remain dead.

No resurrection. No continuation. No evolution. No governance.

Only the fossil remains.
