      "objection": "I don't have time",
      "diffuse": "That's exactly why this works - it's only 15 minutes a day. Most clients do it during lunch or while their kids are doing homework. If you have time to scroll social media, you have time for this."
    },
    {
      "objection": "I've tried everything before",
      "diffuse": "I hear you - most programs fail because they're not designed for real people with real lives. This is different because it adapts to YOUR schedule, YOUR preferences, and YOUR body. Plus, our 97% success rate speaks for itself."
    },
    {
      "objection": "It's too expensive",
      "diffuse": "I understand - let me ask you this: what's it costing you NOT to solve this? The medical bills, the missed opportunities, the confidence tax? Most clients tell us this investment paid for itself in healthcare savings alone."

    {
      "objection": "Will it work for my age/situation?",
      "diffuse": "Great question. We've helped thousands of clients in their 40s, 50s, and beyond. In fact, Sarah was 52 with bad knees and a full-time job - she lost 35 pounds in 4 months using modified exercises designed for her."

    {
      "objection": "I can't stick to diets",
