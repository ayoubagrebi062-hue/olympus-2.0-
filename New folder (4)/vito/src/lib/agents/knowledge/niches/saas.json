    },
    {
      "objection": "We've tried similar tools before and they failed",
      "diffuse": "I appreciate your caution. Can I ask what went wrong? Most failed implementations come from poor fit or weak support. We actually offer a pilot program where you can test with a small team first, and our 98% retention rate shows we're different."

    {
      "objection": "It's too expensive",
      "diffuse": "Let's calculate your current cost of not solving this. Between the hours wasted on manual work, the tools you're paying for, and the opportunities missed - most teams find they're spending more on their current pain than our solution would cost."
