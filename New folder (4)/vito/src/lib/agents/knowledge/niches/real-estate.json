    {
      "objection": "I'm waiting for the market to drop",
      "diffuse": "I understand the hesitation. Here's the data: historically, people who time the market lose more to rising prices than they save waiting. In the last 5 years alone, average prices rose 40%. Even if there's a dip, it rarely offsets years of appreciation. Let's look at some numbers for your specific situation."
    },
    {
      "objection": "I already have an agent",
      "diffuse": "That's great that you're working with someone. Out of curiosity, are they meeting your expectations? If you're ever not getting the level of service you deserve, I'd be happy to show you how we do things differently. No pressure at all."
    },
    {
      "objection": "I'm not ready to buy yet",
      "diffuse": "That's totally fine - let me ask, what would make you ready? Sometimes it's about knowing what you can afford or understanding the process better. I'm happy to chat now so when you ARE ready, you can move fast. The best deals don't wait."
    },
    {
      "objection": "Real estate seems too risky",
      "diffuse": "Risk is real, but it's also manageable. I specialize in helping clients understand exactly what they're getting into before they commit. With proper due diligence and the right strategy, real estate is one of the most consistent wealth builders. Let me show you how we mitigate risk."
    },
    {
      "objection": "I can't afford to buy in this market",
      "diffuse": "You might be surprised. There are programs for first-time buyers, down payment assistance, and creative financing options most people don't know about. Let's run some numbers together - many of my clients thought they couldn't afford it until we explored the options."
    },
    {
      "objection": "I'll just use Zillow/Redfin",
      "diffuse": "Those are great research tools, and I encourage you to use them. But here's what they can't give you: off-market inventory, negotiation expertise, local market insight, and someone advocating for your interests. The technology is a complement, not a replacement."
    },
    {
      "objection": "How are you different from other agents?",
      "diffuse": "Fair question. Three things: First, I respond within 10 minutes, not 10 hours. Second, I have access to off-market inventory through my investor network. Third, I don't just find you a house - I build you a strategy. My clients come back for their second and third properties because of the relationship we build."
    },
    {
      "objection": "I've had bad experiences with agents before",
      "diffuse": "I'm sorry to hear that - unfortunately, not all agents are created equal. I operate on a 'service first' model, which means you're never pressured. Read my reviews, talk to past clients, and see for yourself. If I'm not the right fit, I'll tell you."
