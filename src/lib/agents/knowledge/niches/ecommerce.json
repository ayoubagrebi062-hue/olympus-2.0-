    {
      "objection": "I've been burned by similar products before",

    },
    {
      "objection": "It's more expensive than what I use now",
      "diffuse": "Fair point - let me share some context. Our formula is more concentrated, so one bottle lasts 2-3x longer. When you do the math, it's actually cheaper per use. Plus, you won't be replacing it every few weeks when it doesn't work."
    },
    {
      "objection": "How do I know this will work for me?",
      "diffuse": "Great question. We've seen results across every skin type, age group, and condition. But don't take our word for it - try it for 60 days with our full money-back guarantee. If it doesn't work for you specifically, you pay nothing."
    },
    {
      "objection": "I don't trust online reviews anymore",
      "diffuse": "Smart thinking - fake reviews are a real problem. That's why we use a verified purchase system - every review is from a confirmed buyer. We also have over 2,000 unboxing videos from real customers on social media you can check."
    },
    {
      "objection": "What if I don't like the smell/texture/taste?",
      "diffuse": "Totally valid concern. We spent 18 months on formulation to get this right. But if it's not for you, our return policy covers personal preference too - not just product issues. Zero risk."
    },
    {
      "objection": "I don't want another subscription trap",
      "diffuse": "We hate those too - that's why our subscription is completely optional and cancel-anytime with one click. No phone calls, no hoops. Most customers choose it for the 20% savings, but one-time purchases are totally fine."
    },
    {
      "objection": "How long until I see results?",
      "diffuse": "Most customers notice a difference within 1-2 weeks. Full results typically show at 4-6 weeks of consistent use. We include a results timeline in every order so you know exactly what to expect and when."
    },
    {
      "objection": "I'll wait for a sale",
      "diffuse": "I get it - but here's the thing: we don't do big discount sales because our pricing is already fair. The 15% first-order discount you see now is actually our best offer. And with our guarantee, there's no reason to wait."
