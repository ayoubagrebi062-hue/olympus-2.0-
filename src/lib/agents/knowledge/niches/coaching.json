  "objections": [
    {
      "objection": "I can figure this out on my own",
      "diffuse": "You absolutely could - you're clearly capable. The question is: how much longer are you willing to wait? The right mentor doesn't give you answers you couldn't find; they help you find them in months instead of years. What's a year of your life worth?"
    },
    {
      "objection": "Coaching seems soft or woo-woo",
      "diffuse": "I get that - there's a lot of fluff out there. My approach is strategy-based and results-driven. We set concrete goals, track metrics, and hold you accountable. It's more like having a business advisor than a therapist."
    },
    {
      "objection": "It's too expensive",
      "diffuse": "Let me reframe that: what's the cost of staying exactly where you are for another year? My clients typically see ROI within 90 days - whether that's revenue, time saved, or opportunities captured. This isn't an expense; it's the highest-return investment you can make."
    },
    {
      "objection": "I don't have time for coaching",
      "diffuse": "That feeling is exactly why you need this. If you're too busy to work ON your life, you'll be stuck working IN it forever. We start by creating space - most clients free up 10+ hours per week within the first month just by clarifying priorities."
    },
    {
      "objection": "I've worked with coaches before and it didn't help",
      "diffuse": "That's valuable information - what was missing? Often it's fit, methodology, or accountability. I offer a chemistry call specifically to ensure we're right for each other before you commit anything. Not every coach is for every person."
    },
    {
      "objection": "How do I know you can help with my specific situation?",
      "diffuse": "Let's find out together. Book a discovery call and share your specific challenges. If I can't help, I'll tell you directly and often refer to someone who can. I only take clients I'm confident I can serve."
    },
    {
      "objection": "I need to talk to my spouse/partner first",
      "diffuse": "Absolutely - this is a significant decision. Would it help if I provided some materials you could share with them? Or we could even do a call together so they can ask questions directly."
    },
    {
      "objection": "What if it doesn't work?",
      "diffuse": "Valid concern. Here's my promise: if you do the work and don't see meaningful progress in 90 days, I'll continue working with you for free until you do. I've never had to invoke that guarantee, but it's there because I believe in this that much."
